			<h2>VenuGopal Mekala</h2>
			<p>My name is venugopal, I’m 20 years old and I am under graduated student from SRM University,b-tech in CSE department. While there, I learned a lot of courses  like Web Development, object oriented program,data structures, and more. I was also part of the cyber security student, and maintained a GPA of 7.5.
			<!---------I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.
			While I don’t have any real-life work experience, I’ve had a lot of exposure to the software environment. A lot of my courses involved working with real companies to solve real problems.
			Now, I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in uni and get some hands-on work experience.--->
